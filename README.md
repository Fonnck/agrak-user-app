# Welcome to agrak-user-app

# Follow the next steps to run agrak-user-app ...

1. Clone the project from main branch => 
2. Run _yarn install_ command in terminal
3. Run _yarn dev_ to start a local deploy
4. Go to _http://127.0.0.1:5173/home_ to see the Magic âœ¨

# Some considerations 
* To edit a user through url use: _http://127.0.0.1:5173/user-control/:id/update_ //An example should be _http://127.0.0.1:5173/user-control/21/update_
* _http://127.0.0.1:5173/ it's the local url that Vite provides to run the project locally, it could change depending of method used to run the project.

Thanks. ðŸ’»ðŸ’¯
